# malware-dev
All my experiments while learning malware-development and analysis

All code here is written by me, but I used https://institute.sektor7.net/ courses as inspiration and tutorial. Please check their courses out they are great!

"Extras" directory contains smaller functions, with pretty good documentation, that describe many malware techniques.

"Projects" directory contains actual projects, mainly from sektor7's courses.
